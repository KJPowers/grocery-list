Bugs
----
- check new product name for duplicated, don't insert, do update
- check units match baseline when using inventory mode
- check new product amount and units are recorded correctly
- for baseline, check Fill to Amount (Max) to be greater than zero and gteq Restock Amount (Min) during updates

Settings
--------
- Force lock between generic and item names (old behavior)
- Require compatible units between inventory and baseline (and list?)
- Show/hide notes (ability to override for the session)

New Features (Next Release)
--------------------------
- Move between lists
- filter list based on input
- "ordered" status

Long Term Goals
---------------
- In shopping mode, check boxes and then submit when done, removing from the list
- Real time check box sync for shopping so you can divide and conquer
- Keep purchase history (add to inventory record)
- Repeatable/storable lists, option to add all or just check against inventory (if enabled)
- Add item amount/unit smartness based on what other users have entered
- Add section of store to product
- Handle typical expiration time
- Recipe support (RecipeML?)
